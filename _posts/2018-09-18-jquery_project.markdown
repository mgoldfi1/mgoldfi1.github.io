I feel like I am finally at the point where I can do things that I consider to be real and practical.  Using buttons and API calls feels very real and very useful.  The rest of the course was a good buildup to this but until this point nothing I really did felt that substantial.  Its really interesting getting things to render using JSON responses.  I enjoyed working on this project as alot of the features required alot of thinking outside of the box.
