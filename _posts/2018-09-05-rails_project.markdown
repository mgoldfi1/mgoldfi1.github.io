The rails project was by far the most challenging project I have worked on thus far.  It required me to really learn how routing and validation works so that my users could successfully sign up.  It also showed me how much work goes into making a fully functional website that isn't simply an html document.  Flash messages, validations, redirects are all important features to have for optimizing the feel of the site and security.  I am glad I got the opportunity to work on something like this and I hope I can improve it.
