At first it was a bit overwhelming creating my own web application with no tests to seed my database for me.  I decided to stick with the topic of a movie website and created a film-review forum where users can review movies and view other users posts.  It was a bit tricky figuring out which pages required a user to be logged in and which ones didn't, but I think my first version of the web application turned out decently.  There will definitely be room for improvement.
