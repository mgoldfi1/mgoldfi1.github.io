It is a surreal feeling to finally be done with the course.  Its been 3 days short of four months, but it has been quite the journey.  I feel like I have learned an incredible amount of new skills that I can't wait to develop professionally.  Working on the portfolio projects taught me a great deal about independence and solving my own issues.  I think its an important concept in the world of programming to be able to tackle your issues and look through solutions online to work them out.  There are so many resources online that almost any issue will be solveable.  Another thing I learned is that projects can be overwhelming given the "blank slate" you start with.  Its difficult to look at a blank text editor and automatically know where to start or what needs to be done.  This is something that I became better at after the CLI project.  Its still amazing to me how far I have come from that first project.  At the time, I was impressed by what I had accomplished, but I was still unaware how much more there was to learn.  Overall, I am very satisfied by my experience, and I can only say that I am excited to continue down the path that I have started down.
