  This was bar none the most in-depth, comprehensive project I have completed thus far.  React on its own is an esoteric, yet valuable asset once you become acquainted with it.  Redux further deepens the utility of react by allowing the global state to be accessed and for it to be changed from within components using dispatch methods.  Pairing these two libraries makes for a very challenging, but powerful tool for web development.  To take this a step further, I had to connect these tools to a rails backend api, pushing and pulling data and updating the "store" or rendering components accordingly.  As opposed to other libraries, I feel like react and redux emphasize the "bigger picture" heavily.  Your store, states, and components must all be connected in a seemingly linear fashion.  Components must be rendered or not rendered depending on information in the store, whereas with just rails and jquery your views are all independent and can be treated as such.  
	Overall, this was a very challenging project, but I am glad I was able to complete it.  Every hurdle required abstract thinking and testing, which is a feeling I sometimes enjoy.  It feels almost bittersweet to have finished this, but I think I am ready to move onto polishing my skills further.
