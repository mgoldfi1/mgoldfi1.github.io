   At first, I was a bit apprehensive about the task of creating my own portfolio project.  As far along as I am in the course, I always felt saving having instructions and tests written for me that would tell me what was or wasn't working.  I finally started, and decided to use Amazon to scrape.  After doing a few hours of work, to my dismay I found out that Amazon has way too much Javascript buried in their HTML to scrape with the methods I know at this point.  A little annoyed that I wasted hours of time, I decided to pick a new website and begin working.  I chose IMDB which is a movie website that has tons of information on movies that are coming to theaters and movies that are already out.  It required a bit of playing around to get the information I wanted, but I was able to perfectly scrape all of the info required for my project.  I created a colorized terminal output that listed the movies that are either in theaters or coming out this week, and a bunch of information about them such as runtime, rating, description, and the actors starring in it.  Overall, I can say that it felt very good working on my own project until completion.  Getting it to work was a very satisfying feeling.  It took a few days of work, but seeing everything come together was the icing on the cake.
